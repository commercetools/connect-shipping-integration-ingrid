Happy path, no error handling...

user is the person shopping
client is our and ingrids client
coco is composible commerse
enabler is the UI we create to enable ingrid
service is the service we create to communicate


User clicks on a button to select shipping method.
the client UI will create coco session and store card id and version there
the client UI will call enabler init with the coco session id
Enabler sends session id to service
The service will fetch the coco sessino to get cart id and version
The service fetches cart from coco using id and version
The service creates ingrid session if none exist
The service will save the ingrid session in the cart if it created the ingrid session
If cart already has ingrid session then the service will validate ingrid cart items with current cart because cart may have changed
    if cart changed then update ingrid
    if cart didn't change do nothing
The service will respond with the ingrid session (as JSON with the html snipped as a json data value)
The enabler will use the returned data to set innerHTML of the configured element (in mount the client would have passed a css selector)
The enabler will listen to data_changed and on change will send the update to service
The service will update the cart with shipping method
