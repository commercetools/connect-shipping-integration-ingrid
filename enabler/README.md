# Shipping Integration Enabler
This module provides an application based on [commercetools Connect](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect), which acts a wrapper implementation to cover frontend components provided by Ingrid delivery platform.

Ingrid provides widget in HTML format that can be used on client side to load on browser which securely render DOM elements for shipping address and shipping option inputs. The widget takes control the collection of delivery details in Ingrid platform. Now, with the usage of `enabler`, it allows the control to checkout product on when and how to load the `enabler` as connector UI based on business configuration. 

## Usage
The `enabler` provides following three functions:
- mount() - It accepts DOM Element ID so that Ingrid widget can be embedded into it.
- init() - It asks the Ingrid platform to initialize delivery session and generate the Ingrid widget for frontend usage.
- update() - It synchronizes the latest shipping options into the cart which is stored in commercetools composable commerce platform.

Following shows how to instantiate web component by `enabler` in frontend

```
    const enabler = new Enabler({
        processorUrl: VITE_PROCESSOR_URL, // inject the processor URL in environment variable
        sessionId: sessionId, // inject the commercetools checkout session ID
        onInitCompleted: ({
            isSuccess: true;
            ingridSessionId: string; // passing delivery session ID generated by Ingrid platform
            ingridHtml: string; // HTML snippet generated by Ingrid platform
            cartVersion: number; // version of cart defined by commercetools composable commerce
        }){
            // Callback function after init() in enabler is completed. the follow-up operations handled in front-end can be defined here.
        },
        onComplete: ({
            isSuccess: boolean,
            ingridSessionId: string; // passing delivery session ID generated by Ingrid platform
            cartVersion: number; // version of cart defined by commercetools composable commerce
        }) => {
            // Callback function after update() in enabler is completed. The follow-up operations handled in front-end can be defined here.
        },
        onError: (err: Error) => {           
            // Callback function if error in enabler happened. The follow-up operations handled in front-end can be defined here.
        }
    });

    enabler.createComponentBuilder();
    const builder = await enabler.createComponentBuilder();
    const enablerComponent = builder.build();

```
To mount the DOM element for Ingrid widget with `enabler`
```
    <div id=${elementIdForIngridWidget} />
    enablerComponent.mount(elementIdForIngridWidget);
```

To trigger Ingrid delivery session initialization
```
    enablerComponent.init(session.id); // pass commercetools checkout session ID
```

To synchronize the latest delivery options from Ingrid to commercetools composable commerce
```
    enablerComponent.update(session.id); // pass commercetools checkout session ID
```

## Getting Started
Please run following npm commands under `enabler` folder for development work in local environment.

#### Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
#### Build the application in local environment. NodeJS source codes are then generated under dist folder
```
